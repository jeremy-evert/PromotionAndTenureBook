"# PromotionAndTenureBook" 

Welcome friends,
If you are reading this, I have finally found a working method for 
writing my promotion and tenure booklet and you have taken an interest.

## Where this came from:
I am using www.github.com to keep track of my work.
I leverage git as a program on my computer to talk to that web site.
I downloaded this from https://www.git-scm.com/
You can too.
There are many good books on how to get started with it. 

I also used LaTeX for the writing.
